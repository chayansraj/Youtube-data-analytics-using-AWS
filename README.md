# Dataset Used 
The dataset contains daily statistics for trending YouTube videos with up to 200 trending videos per day. It includes several months of data on daily trending YouTube videos. Major nations covered in this dataset are US, GB, DE, CA, JP, IN, and FR regions (USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, Japan, India, and France, respectively). 
* There are two parts to this dataset:
  1. Each regionâ€™s trending video data is in a separate .csv file. Data includes both numerical and categorical columns and some of them are the video title, channel title, publish time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count.
  2. Each video is also associated with its video category which is stored in a separate .json file that varies between regions.
