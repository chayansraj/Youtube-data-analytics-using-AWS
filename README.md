# Data Engineering Youtube video analytics using AWS (End-to-End)
This project aims to leverage Amazon Web Services to create a youtube trending video analytics service. The project contains different data engineering, data analysis, and data science sections.

# Project Goals

1. Data Ingestion - Create a data ingestion pipeline to extract new incoming data into the AWS data lake.
2. Data Lake - Create a centralized repository to store data from multiple sources and of different formats.
3. Data ETL Jobs - Create Extract, Transform, and Load jobs to preprocess raw data into usable proper versions.
4. Data Analysis - Create SQL queries to analyze data to create key insights about the product.
5. Data Reporting/Analytics - Create dashboards to answer questions and communicate insights to the Stakeholders.


# Data Architecture

The architecture (Data flow) used in this project uses different AWS functionalities.

# Dataset Used 
The dataset contains daily statistics for trending YouTube videos with up to 200 trending videos per day. It includes several months of data on daily trending YouTube videos. Major nations covered in this dataset are US, GB, DE, CA, JP, IN, and FR regions (USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, Japan, India, and France, respectively). 
* There are two parts to this dataset:
  1. Each regionâ€™s trending video data is in a separate .csv file. Data includes both numerical and categorical columns and some of them are the video title, channel title, publish time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count.
  2. Each video is also associated with its video category which is stored in a separate .json file that varies between regions.

# Amazon Web Services used in this project
1. **AWS S3**: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a storage service that offers high scalability, data availability, security, and performance. It stores the data as objects within buckets and is readily available for integration with thousands of applications. An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file. A bucket is a container for objects. <br />
2. **AWS IAM**: Amazon Identity and Access Management is a service to securely control access to AWS Services. It is used to manage permissions for different roles under various scenarios. IAM is used to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.<br />
3. **AWS Glue**: It is a scalable, serverless data integration service that can be used to discover, prepare, and combine data for application development, analytics, and machine learning. AWS Glue consolidates major data integration capabilities into a single service. It also provides DataOps tools to effortlessly author, run jobs, and implement business workflows.<br />
4. **AWS Lambda**: It is a compute service that provides a runtime environment letting you run code without provisioning or managing servers. The code is written in Lambda functions and is set to trigger as per the use case and is scaled as per the demand.<br />
5. **AWS Athena**: It is a query service that allows easy analysis of data stored directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Amazon Athena also makes it easy to interactively run data analytics using Apache Spark without having to plan for, configure, or manage resources.
6. **AWS QuickSight**: It is a cloud-based Business Intelligence service that can be used to deliver easy-to-use insights and answer questions to the stakeholders. There are a lot of data integration options where in a single data dashboard, QuickSight can include AWS data, third-party data, big data, spreadsheet data, SaaS data, B2B data, and more.

# Implementation

* Step 1 - Ingest data from Kaggle to Amazon S3 buckets.
